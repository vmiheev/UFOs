## Summary

### Drawbacks
One drawback of this webpage is that it uses a fixed dataset; the ability to update the dataset would make the data much more dynamic.

### Further Development
Further development would focus on creating a function that updates the dataset. Additionally, a dropdown of values for the filters would be a useful feature.
